## Project Overview

This project presents a scalable end-to-end data pipeline designed for processing and analyzing car sales data using the Azure Cloud and Databricks ecosystem. The pipeline collects data from various sources, processes it, and stores it for analysis. It leverages the capabilities of Azure services to ensure efficiency and scalability.

The goal is to provide a comprehensive solution for car sales data analysis, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Azure Cloud**: Provides a robust infrastructure for deploying services.
- **Azure Databricks**: A collaborative platform for data science and engineering.
- **Azure Data Factory**: For orchestrating data movement and transformation.
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2**: For scalable data storage.
- **Azure SQL Database**: For relational data storage.
- **Delta Lake**: For managing large datasets with ACID transactions.
- **PySpark**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Unity Catalog**: For managing data governance.

## Features

- **Scalable Data Pipeline**: The architecture supports growth in data volume.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Enables timely insights from car sales data.
- **Data Quality Checks**: Ensures data integrity throughout the pipeline.
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Provides various metrics and reports on car sales.
- **User-Friendly Notebooks**: Easy-to-follow Databricks notebooks for data analysis.

## Data Pipeline Architecture

The data pipeline consists of several key components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Data is ingested from various sources, including APIs and CSV files.
2. **Data Storage**: Raw data is stored in Azure Data Lake Gen2.
3. **Data Processing**: PySpark jobs transform and clean the data.
4. **Data Storage**: Processed data is stored in Delta Lake tables.
5. **Data Analysis**: Users can run queries and generate reports using Databricks notebooks.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sung313/Car-Sales-End-to-End-Data-Engineering-Project-using-Azure-Databricks.git
   cd Car-Sales-End-to-End-Data-Engineering-Project-using-Azure-Databricks
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pyspark azure-storage-blob azure-sql
   ```

3. **Configure Azure Services**:
   - Set up an Azure account and create the necessary resources (Data Lake, Databricks workspace, etc.).
   - Update the configuration files with your Azure credentials.

4. **Run the Notebooks**:
   - Open the Databricks workspace and import the notebooks from the repository.
   - Execute the notebooks to start the data pipeline.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can use the notebooks to analyze car sales data. Here are some example analyses you can perform:

- **Sales Trends**: Analyze trends over time to identify peak sales periods.
- **Customer Insights**: Understand customer demographics and preferences.
- **Inventory Management**: Monitor inventory levels and turnover rates.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the notebooks provided in the repository.
